Python library for XY_433 GPIO transmitters on raspberry pi.
Allows sending codes to 433Mhz devices such as remote control 
(on/off) of sockets and central heating systems.

requires gpiozero:
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero

usage:
from XY_433 import XY_433_trans

transmitter = XY_433_trans(pin)
transmitter.XY_send(code, bits)
